# BIM5D Application
- <strong>BIM5D is a project which is the application to support Civil Engineer in quantity construction calculation and cost estimation. </strong>
- Simply understanding, in the AEC (Architectural Engineering and Construction) industry, I have a building, I have to know quantities of everything (concrete, tiles, ceiling, rebar, brick ... etc)
Then, I calculate the cost estimate of that building.

- It's written by Revit API, C# (OOP, winforms), SQL, VBScript.
<h4>The application includes 3 main part: </h4>
<strong>
	<ul>
	<li>1. bim5d software: Core, this part calculates all elements of the building, contains algorithm, rules, calculation</li>
	<li>2. bim5d add-in: Add-in attaches to Autodesk Software, supports throughout the building modeling process</li>
	<li>3. bim5d database management: arranges, backup, saves all components database of BIM technologist</li>
	</ul>
</strong>

<h3>This repo is BIM5D Database management: </h3>

- This is a simple tool that helps you manage family file systems (Revit or even any type of files).
- This VBScript Macro contains 6 contents about 6 Departments in Construction.
- My workflow will be shown below:

- You can get files then manage them and sync files anytime you want.
- You can customize visibility Family files of every Department if you want, such as name, location, feature, characteristic...
